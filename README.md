## Install

### Manual
#### FrontEnd 

> $git clone https://github.com/rubenkharel/erekon

> $cd erekon/frontend

> $npm install

> $npm start

#### Backend

> $cd erekon/backend

> $npm install

> $npm start

#### Database

Makesure you have mongod working properly on your system

> $mongod --noauth --port 4000 --dbpath ~/where/to/create/your/database

or you can just get a free mongodb cluster(ig) and modify MONGO_CONNECT's value on `.env` file.


### Docker???
I still dont know the D of docker. You can send PR if you are willing to create a dockerfile

## Warning and Some infos about repo.

Vulnerable af, host it only in private environment.

Since, this was the first ever (maybe second, idk) project I built after learning Node.js, I believe its very messy with bad practices... so, it might make you go bang your head on wall if you start doing code review.

But I assure you this repo is very beginner friendly to get you started on opensource contribution.

Create issue if you have any feature request, which I never may build unless I get some free time and get high and think that actually is a great feature to implement.

PR are more then welcome, Any kind of PR... Readme update, READ_BEFORE_CONTRIBUTE.md? kinda thing, or bug fixes? dockerimage? code refactor? anything.. just send PR. I dont have to get high to consider approving PRs btw.
